## Setup

### Get API Credentials

You will need to [enable the api](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sheets.googleapis.com)
then [create credentials](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application)

Copy paste your client email and private key into the app.js on line 23 & 24

### Getting the spreadsheet

Make a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13kDO33IB1nm56qlHeq9o9EmHaJsOyPZ9Of2C10O83-E/edit?usp=sharing)
Share it with your email, make sure it has editing rights

### The client-side

Currently client side is handled with the app [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) So you'll want to install that
Sorry Apple users

The tasks and profile are in the repository, you'll just have to replace the ip address in them
